# Let's see the function called
info functions

# We can see function gets, strdup, main and p, let's disas t have an idea for calling order.
disas main

# main call p func without any arguments, let's then disas p
disas p

# We can see call of gets, printf, strdup. Seems like we cant use the same exploit than last level with EIP, stack is lock this time.
