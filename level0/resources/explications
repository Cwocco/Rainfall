# We can't run the binary file, it segfault
# Let's try to give it an arg, it prints "No !"
# Let's gdb to see where it segfault and why
# Set a breakpoint and go slowly to check from where it comes

gdb ./level0
b main
run
ni # let's do that until we got the segfault
# It segfault on 0x08048ed4 register
# We can see it match with a call of atoi and we can see there is also a cmp call right after atoi's call
# Let's check what value is compared, we have  0x08048ed9 <+25>:	cmp    $0x1a7,%eax
# 0x1a7 needs to be converted from hexa to decimal, we found out the value is 423
# Which means atoi is waiting for 423 value
# Let's try to run the binary with this value as arg
# It returns us on a new prompt
# Let's check if we can cat the file .pass with new prompt
# As said in the subject, pass is in /home/user/level1/.pass file

cat /home/user/level1/.pass
